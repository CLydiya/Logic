# Logic
The basic of mathematics. This is from my 10th grade maths lesson which is about statements and how to prove the statements.
# Definition
Logic is the study of methods, structures, and proofs. In mathematical logic, we learn how to prove mathematical statements based on reasoning. 
# Statement
Satement is a sentence that is either true or false. 

Example: 
p: 6 is divisible by 3. 
The sentence p is a satement because we can conclude that it is true.

q: This sentence is false. 
The sentence q is not a statement because it is unclear that which sentence is false. In other words, we can't conclude it as true or false, thus, it is not a statement.
# Compound statements
The examples above are simple statement. We can combine them, making a compound statement.

Example: 
s: 6 is divisible by 3, and this sentence is false. 
the sentence s is a compound statement because it is a combination of statement p and q.
