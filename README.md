# Logic
The basic of mathematics. This is from my 10th grade maths lesson which is about statements and how to prove the statements.
# Definition
Logic is the study of methods, structures, and proofs. In mathematical logic, we learn how to prove mathematical propositions based on reasoning. 
# Proposition
Proposition is a sentence that is either true or false. 

Example: 
p: 6 is divisible by 3. 
The sentence p is a proposition because we can conclude that it is true.

q: This sentence is false. 
The sentence q is not a proposition because it is unclear that which sentence is false. In other words, we can't conclude it as true or false, thus, it is not a proposition.
# Compound propositions 
The examples above are simple propositions. We can combine them, making a compound proposition.

Example: 
s: 6 is divisible by 3, and this sentence is false. 
the sentence s is a compound proposition because it is a combination of propositions p and q.
# Truth vale
The logical propositions have two possible values which are true or false. It is denoted by T or 1 if the proposition is true, and F or 0 if the proposition is false. 
<h1>Connective</h1> 
<p>When we want to combine two or more propositions together, we use Connective. The connective are negation, conjunction, disjunction, implication, and equivalence.</p>
<h2>Negation</h2>
<p>The negation of the proposition &#112 is not true and denoted by &not&#112. The truth value of the negation of a proposition depends on the truth value of the original proposition. If the original proposition is true, then its negation is false, and vice versa.

For example:
- If p is "It is raining," then &not&#112 is "It is not raining."
- If q is "The cat is on the mat," then &not&#113 is "The cat is not on the mat."

So, the truth value of &not&#112 or &not&#113 is the opposite of the truth value of &not&#112 or &not&#113, respectively.</p>
